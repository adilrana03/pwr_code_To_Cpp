Java to C++ Conversion Project
# Introduction
 Welcome to the Java to C++ Conversion Project! This repository is dedicated to converting a specific Java codebase into C++. Our goal is to leverage the strengths of C++ for performance optimization, wider application compatibility, and more.

# Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and review the existing Java codebase. Familiarity with both Java and C++ is recommended for effective contribution.

# Prerequisites
A working knowledge of Java and C++.
An IDE or editor capable of handling Java and C++ development (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, CLion).
Git for version control.
Contributing
We encourage contributions in various forms. Here's how you can contribute:

# Code Conversion: Convert Java code segments to C++.
# Code Review: Review converted C++ code for syntax and logical errors.
Testing: Write and perform tests for both Java and C++ code to ensure equivalent functionality.
Documentation: Improve and update documentation to reflect changes and provide clear instructions.
# Guidelines
Ensure code readability and maintainability.
Follow best practices for both Java and C++ coding.
Document your changes and provide comments for complex conversions.
Test your changes thoroughly before pushing.
